/**
 * This is the extended service health check. It is used to verify that your service passes a
 * deployment validation.
 *
 * <p>This differs from your regular healthcheck because it is not (and should not be) used by your
 * load balancer to determine if this host is ready to accept traffic because this necessarily tests
 * central resource all hosts have in common. Concretely, some load balancers misbehave when all
 * hosts suddenly become unhealthy as a result of that common resource becoming unavailable,
 * dropping all traffic instead of picking a host at random to try serve the request anyway.
 *
 * <p>Dropwizard merges all healthChecks into a single API, so this is implemented as a Task to
 * prevent that.
 *
 * <p>This is registered on the admin API to prevent needing to implement auth in your
 * postDeployValidate.sh to talk to your main API.
